CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization
3D Scene Project Portfolio Artifact
Overview

This repository contains my final project for CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization. The purpose of this project was to design and develop a fully realized 3D scene using modern graphics programming techniques. The project demonstrates my understanding of rendering, lighting, textures, spatial design, and iterative software development.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design by first understanding the problem and identifying the required functionality. I break systems into smaller components and focus on structure, clarity, and maintainability before implementation. This helps ensure the software remains scalable and easier to modify.

What new design skills did this project help you develop?

This project strengthened my spatial reasoning and visual system design. I improved planning object placement, lighting interaction, and texture coordination within a 3D environment. I also gained experience designing around constraints such as camera perspective and rendering behavior.

What design process did you follow?

I followed an iterative approach. I began with a simple scene layout and gradually added objects, textures, and lighting. After each milestone, I evaluated the scene and refined positioning, lighting balance, and camera interaction until the final result was visually coherent and stable.

How can your design tactics be used in future work?

Breaking large systems into manageable parts and refining them incrementally helps improve quality and reduce errors. This approach applies to any complex software project, especially systems with multiple interacting components.

How do I approach developing programs?

I begin with planning and structure, then implement core functionality, and finally refine and optimize. I focus on readable code, consistent formatting, and frequent testing to detect issues early and maintain organization.

What new development strategies did you use?

I used incremental rendering development, testing individual components such as camera movement, lighting, and textures separately. I also strengthened my ability to debug visual and spatial issues by adjusting transformations and lighting parameters.

How did iteration impact your development?

Iteration was essential. Each milestone required revisiting and improving earlier work. Repeated refinement of lighting, textures, and object positioning helped transform a basic scene into a polished final product.

How has your development approach evolved?

Early in the project, my focus was on functionality. As the project progressed, I improved code structure, debugging methods, and workflow efficiency. By the final stage, my process became more systematic and organized.

How can computer science help me reach my goals?

Computer science builds problem solving ability, structured thinking, and technical skills. These abilities support my academic progress and long term goals in software and technology.

How does computational graphics support your educational pathway?

This course strengthened my understanding of rendering, transformations, lighting models, and spatial computation. These concepts support further study in graphics, simulation, and advanced visualization.

How does computational graphics support your professional pathway?

This project developed skills relevant to real world development such as debugging complex systems, working with rendering pipelines, and designing interactive visual environments. These skills are applicable in software development, simulation, game development, and visualization.
